      I'm Trevor, a full-stack software engineer with a driving passion when it
      comes to creating web sites and applications. During the day (and often at
      night), you'll find me typing away with my headset on, or connecting with
      colleagues about our latest work. Outside of software development, I spend
      most of my time with my wife, Mackenzie, our two girls, Charlotte
      'Charli', Rebecca, and Bailey the Beagle.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In the off chance I have time outside of all this, I enjoy learning new
      programming languages and technologies, playing games with friends, and
      watching car racing.
