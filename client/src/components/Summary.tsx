        I'm Trevor, a full-stack software engineer with a driving passion when
        it comes to creating web sites and applications. During the day (and
        often at night), you'll find me typing away with my headset on, or
        connecting with colleagues about our latest work. Outside of software
        development, I spend most of my time with my wife, Mackenzie, our two
        girls, Charlotte 'Charli', Rebecca, and Bailey the Beagle.

        In the off chance I have time outside of all this, I enjoy learning new
        programming languages and technologies, playing games with friends, and
        watching car racing.
