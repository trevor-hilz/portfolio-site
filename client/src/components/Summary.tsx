      I'm Trevor, a full-stack software engineer with a deep passion for
      building intuitive websites and applications. Whether it's day or night,
      you'll find me coding with my headset on or collaborating with colleagues
      to tackle our latest projects. I specialize in technologies like
      JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Rest and more and enjoy pushing
      the boundaries of what’s possible with web development.

      Outside of software, I spend most of my time with my wife Mackenzie, our
      two girls, Charlotte 'Charli' and Rebecca, and our Beagle, Bailey. When
      I’m not coding or with my family, I enjoy exploring new programming
      languages, playing games with friends, and catching car racing whenever I
      get the chance.
